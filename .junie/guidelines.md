# GoEdit Project Overview

## Introduction
GoEdit is an experimental text editor for GoLang, designed to provide a modern, feature-rich editing experience with language-specific intelligence. The project aims to create a terminal-based editor with advanced features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and efficient text manipulation.

## Architecture
The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components
1. **Editor Interface**: Defines the contract for text editing operations that any editor implementation must fulfill.
2. **Editor Implementations**: 
   - `DirtSimpleEditor`: A basic implementation of the Editor interface that handles text and styling.
   - Future implementations may include more sophisticated editors with additional features.
3. **Main Application**: Handles UI rendering, user input, and coordinates between different components.
4. **Language Server Protocol (LSP) Integration**: Provides code intelligence features like completion and syntax highlighting.

### Data Structures
The project explores different approaches to text storage and manipulation:
- **Pieces Table**: Considered for efficient undo/redo operations
- **Rope Structure**: Potentially used for style information

## Features
- Terminal-based UI using the tcell library
- Text editing capabilities (insert, delete, navigate)
- Syntax highlighting
- Code completion via LSP
- Multiple view areas
- File loading and saving

## Development Guidelines
1. **Code Organization**:
   - Keep related functionality in appropriate packages
   - Follow Go best practices for package structure
   - Maintain clear separation between UI and text manipulation logic

2. **Interface Design**:
   - Use interfaces to define contracts between components
   - Implement concrete types that fulfill these interfaces
   - Allow for multiple implementations of core interfaces

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Use appropriate error handling patterns
   - Log errors for debugging purposes
   - Provide meaningful error messages to users

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Optimize text storage and manipulation for large files
   - Consider memory usage when implementing features
   - Ensure UI remains responsive during intensive operations

## Future Directions
- Enhanced LSP integration for more language features
- Improved syntax highlighting
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Configuration options for customization
- Multiple file support with tabbed interface
